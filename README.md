# Introduction and Explanation

You'll add the mod. You'll enable the mod.

Within the game, it adds a MainTab, probably in the far-bottom-right-corner, labeled "ModButtons".

This MainTab contains a variety of buttons, which will perform bulk operations on every selected pawn.

You can do all of the following:

* Set Outfit
* Set Allowed Area
* Set Drug Policy
* Set Food Restriction
* Set Medical Care
* Set Enemy Response (Attack, Flee, Ignore).
* Drop Everything (Inventory, not Equipment/Apparel)
* Consume from Inventory (Everybody eat your meal and smoke your blunt)
* ~Assign Operations (Assign Peg Leg operations to all 19 prisoners)~

Operations removed for now until I fix it.

Hooray! So much less clicking!

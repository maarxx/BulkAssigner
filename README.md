# Introduction

The mod provides some functions for bulk manipulation of assign functions, such as Hostility Reponse Mode, Outfit, Drug Policy, and Allowed Areas.

The dependency "ModButtons" will add a similarly-named tab in the bottom-right corner, with some control buttons.

This MainTab contains a variety of buttons, which will perform bulk operations on every selected pawn.

You can do all of the following:

* Set Outfit
* Set Allowed Area
* Set Drug Policy
* Set Food Restriction
* Set Medical Care
* Set Enemy Response (Attack, Flee, Ignore).
* Drop Everything (Inventory, not Equipment/Apparel)
* Consume from Inventory (Everybody eat your meal and smoke your blunt)
* ~Assign Operations (Assign Peg Leg operations to all 19 prisoners)~

Operations removed for now until I fix it.

Hooray! So much less clicking!
